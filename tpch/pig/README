TPC-H Benchmark
===============
TPC-H is an ad-hoc, decision support benchmark.

TPC-H official webpage: http://www.tpc.org/tpch/
Pig JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2397


Data Generation
===============
The data generation script are located in the 'tpch/datagen' directory.
Refer to the 'tpch/datagen/README' file for more info.

Notes:
1) The data is generated in text format and the columns are separated by '|'.
2) The data file(s) for each table are placed in a directory $dir/$table_name
for each table.


Run Benchmark
=============
./run_tpch.sh <input_dir> <output_dir> <reducers> [<hadoop_opts>]

where:
   input_dir:   The input directory on HDFS
   output_dir:  The output directory on HDFS
   reducers:    The number of reduce tasks to use per MapReduce job
   hadoop_opts: Optional Hadoop options (-conf or -D)

Tip: You can get the tab-separated timings using:
>$ grep "times (sec)" out.log


Run Individual Scripts
======================
${PIG_HOME}/bin/pig $hadoop_opts -param input=<input_dir> -param output=<output_dir> -param reducers=<reducers> -f queries/<script_name>

where:
   input_dir:  The pigmix input directory on the DFS
   output_dir: The output directory on the DFS
   reducers:   The number of reduce tasks to user per MapReduce job
   <script_name>: One of the Q<X>.pig script in the scripts dir


Use with Starfish
=================
For executing, profiling, and optimizing the queries using Starfish, use
the exec_tpch.sh, profile_tpch.sh, and optimize_tpch.sh scripts respectively.
